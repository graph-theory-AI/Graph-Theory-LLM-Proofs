Exponential order of K_r-free degenerate χ=d+1 graphs — Graph-theory open problems (arXiv)

 
 Status

 Problem 6.3 asks whether every $K_r$-free $d$-degenerate graph with chromatic number $d+1$ must have $e^{\Omega_r(d)}$ vertices, extending the paper's main result from the triangle-free case ($r=3$) to all $r$. The source paper establishes the $r=3$ case, proving $e^{\Omega(d)} \le f(d) \le e^{O(d^2 \log d)}$ for triangle-free $d$-degenerate graphs, but leaves the general $r$ case open. No follow-up resolving this problem was found in a wide literature search conducted in May 2026.

 Reviewer notes. The paper is very recent (January 2026). The triangle-free case ($r=3$) is settled by the main results of arXiv:2601.15245 itself. For general $r \ge 4$, the paper shows that $K_r$-free $d$-degenerate graphs can have fractional chromatic number $\Omega_r(d/\log^{r-2} d)$, but whether the minimum order of a $(d+1)$-chromatic example must be exponential in $d$ (Problem 6.3) remains unresolved. No citing or follow-up paper addressing this problem was identified.

Problem. Is it true that if the chromatic number of a $K_{r}$-free $d$-degenerate graph is $d+1$, then the graph has $e^{\Omega_{r}(d)}$ vertices?

Context

The main results of the paper establish that triangle-free $d$-degenerate graphs with at most $2^{cd}$ vertices have chromatic number strictly less than $d+1$; this problem asks whether the exponential lower bound on the order of extremal examples extends from the triangle-free case ($r=3$) to all $r$.

Abstract:The classic upper bound on the chromatic number of $d$-degenerate graphs is $d+1$, shown to be tight by complete graphs. A natural question is whether this bound remains tight if one forbids large cliques. Classic constructions of Tutte and Zykov from the early 50s show that there exist $d$-degenerate $(d+1)$-chromatic graphs that are triangle-free, however these constructions grow rapidly with $d$. Motivated by this and addressing a problem posed by the second author at the Oberwolfach Graph Theory workshop, we prove that the minimum order $f(d)$ of a $d$-degenerate triangle-free graph of chromatic number $d+1$ satisfies $e^{\Omega(d)}\le f(d)\le e^{O(d^2\log d)}.$ The lower bound follows from a novel upper bound on the chromatic number of triangle-free graphs: Every triangle-free $d$-degenerate graph $G$ on $n \le e^{O(d)}$ vertices satisfies $$\chi(G)\le O\left(\frac{d}{\log\left(d/\log n\right)}\right).$$ We extend this to a more general result about degenerate graphs with sparse neighborhoods, which has applications to many graph coloring problems: For example, we prove that every counterexample to Hadwiger's conjecture with parameter $t$ must have a complete bipartite subgraph with one exponentially large side ($K_{a,b}$ where $a=(\log t)^{1/2-o(1)}$ and $b=e^{t^{1-o(1)}}$) or a small and very dense subgraph (of order $\le t$ with $t^{2-o(1)}$ edges) in some neighborhood.
For the upper bound on $f(d)$ we establish a surprising connection between $f(d)$ and the on-line-chromatic number $g(n)$ of $n$-vertex triangle-free graphs. We also give an asymptotic improvement of the previous best upper bound for $g(n)$ due to Lovász, Saks and Trotter from 1989.
Along the way we disprove a generalization of Harris' fractional coloring conjecture to graphs of bounded clique number and raise numerous problems which open up interesting directions to explore for future research.
