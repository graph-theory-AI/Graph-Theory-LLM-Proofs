 Problem 6.1 of arXiv:2601.15245 asks whether the upper bound $2^{cd}$ on the number of vertices in Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 can be weakened to $e^{\omega(d)}$, with a corresponding improvement of the chromatic number bound, and whether large constant girth additionally helps. The paper itself establishes $e^{\Omega(d)} \leq f(d) \leq e^{O(d^2 \log d)}$ for the minimum order of a $d$-degenerate triangle-free $(d+1)$-chromatic graph, showing an exponential gap between the lower bound on $f(d)$ and the vertex regime covered by the main theorems. No follow-up resolving or making partial progress on Problem 6.1 has been found in the literature as of May 2026, which is expected given the paper's January 2026 submission date.

 Reviewer notes. No follow-up found. The conjecture is very recent (January 2026). The key open gap is between the vertex regime $n \leq 2^{cd}$ covered by the main theorems and the sub-exponential regime $n = e^{\omega(d)}$; resolving it is noted by the authors as the most important open problem from their paper and would have implications for Erd\H{o}s's problem on graph Ramsey numbers for triangle-free graphs.

Problem. Can the upper bound $2^{cd}$ on the number of vertices assumed in Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 be weakened to $e^{\omega(d)}$ (with a corresponding improvement of the upper bound on $\chi$ when $n=e^{\omega(d)}$)? What if we additionally assume that the graph has large (constant) girth?

Context

The perhaps most important open problem left by the paper is whether the exponential requirement on the number of vertices in Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 can be further relaxed. Even improving the constant $c$ in Theorem 1.1 could resolve Erdős's problem on graph Ramsey numbers for all triangle-free graphs by combining with the trivial lower bound $r(G)\geq|V(G)|$.

Abstract:The classic upper bound on the chromatic number of $d$-degenerate graphs is $d+1$, shown to be tight by complete graphs. A natural question is whether this bound remains tight if one forbids large cliques. Classic constructions of Tutte and Zykov from the early 50s show that there exist $d$-degenerate $(d+1)$-chromatic graphs that are triangle-free, however these constructions grow rapidly with $d$. Motivated by this and addressing a problem posed by the second author at the Oberwolfach Graph Theory workshop, we prove that the minimum order $f(d)$ of a $d$-degenerate triangle-free graph of chromatic number $d+1$ satisfies $e^{\Omega(d)}\le f(d)\le e^{O(d^2\log d)}.$ The lower bound follows from a novel upper bound on the chromatic number of triangle-free graphs: Every triangle-free $d$-degenerate graph $G$ on $n \le e^{O(d)}$ vertices satisfies $$\chi(G)\le O\left(\frac{d}{\log\left(d/\log n\right)}\right).$$ We extend this to a more general result about degenerate graphs with sparse neighborhoods, which has applications to many graph coloring problems: For example, we prove that every counterexample to Hadwiger's conjecture with parameter $t$ must have a complete bipartite subgraph with one exponentially large side ($K_{a,b}$ where $a=(\log t)^{1/2-o(1)}$ and $b=e^{t^{1-o(1)}}$) or a small and very dense subgraph (of order $\le t$ with $t^{2-o(1)}$ edges) in some neighborhood.
For the upper bound on $f(d)$ we establish a surprising connection between $f(d)$ and the on-line-chromatic number $g(n)$ of $n$-vertex triangle-free graphs. We also give an asymptotic improvement of the previous best upper bound for $g(n)$ due to Lovász, Saks and Trotter from 1989.
Along the way we disprove a generalization of Harris' fractional coloring conjecture to graphs of bounded clique number and raise numerous problems which open up interesting directions to explore for future research.
